Book store app with changes:

Was implemented feature when book haven't been sold by 10 seconds - then price of it low on 30%. Such a sale.

Was added WakerBehaviour behaviour with handleElapsedTimeout handler, that catching once, when timeout is over.

Also was changed timeout of WorkerBuyer request from 6 seconds to 2 seconds - it's shorting time of debugging.
